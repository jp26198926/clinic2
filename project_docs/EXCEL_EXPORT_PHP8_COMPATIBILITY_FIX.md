# Excel Export PHP 8+ Compatibility Fix - Complete

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

### Problem Fixed:

Excel export functionality was failing with PHP 8+ due to incompatible PHPExcel library that used deprecated curly brace array syntax.

### Root Cause:

The old PHPExcel library was not compatible with PHP 8+ and would throw fatal errors:

```
Fatal error: Array and string offset access syntax with curly braces is no longer supported
```

### Solution Implemented:

#### ✅ Migrated to PhpSpreadsheet

**Modern Library**: Replaced deprecated PHPExcel with modern PhpSpreadsheet library

- **Old**: PHPExcel (deprecated, PHP 8+ incompatible)
- **New**: PhpSpreadsheet (maintained, PHP 8+ compatible)

#### ✅ Updated Excel Export Method

**File**: `application/controllers/Inventory_reports.php`
**Method**: `export_excel()` - Completely rewritten to use PhpSpreadsheet

### Key Changes Made:

#### 1. Library Loading

```php
// OLD: CodeIgniter library (PHPExcel wrapper)
$this->load->library('excel');

// NEW: Direct PhpSpreadsheet via Composer autoloader
require_once FCPATH . 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

#### 2. Object Creation

```php
// OLD: PHPExcel wrapper
$this->excel->setActiveSheetIndex(0);
$this->excel->getActiveSheet()->setTitle($report_title);

// NEW: Direct PhpSpreadsheet
$spreadsheet = new \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Spreadsheet();
$worksheet = $spreadsheet->getActiveSheet();
$worksheet->setTitle($report_title);
```

#### 3. Cell Operations

```php
// OLD: Through CodeIgniter wrapper
$this->excel->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('A1', $value);
$this->excel->getActiveSheet()->getStyle('A1')->getFont()->setBold(true);

// NEW: Direct PhpSpreadsheet API
$worksheet->setCellValue('A1', $value);
$worksheet->getStyle('A1')->getFont()->setBold(true);
```

#### 4. File Export

```php
// OLD: PHPExcel IOFactory
$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($this->excel, 'Excel2007');
$objWriter->save('php://output');

// NEW: PhpSpreadsheet Writer
$writer = new \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Writer\Xlsx($spreadsheet);
$writer->save('php://output');
```
