# Excel Export Fix - Implementation Complete

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

### Problem Fix

ed:
The Excel export functionality in the inventory reports page was redirecting all Excel exports to PDF as a fallback instead of generating actual Excel files.

### Root

Cause:
The `export_report` method in `Inventory_reports.php` contained a fallback mechanism that redirected Excel requests to PDF export with the comment "For now, redirect to PDF export (Excel can be implemented later)".

### Solution Implemented:

#### 1. ✅ Complete Excel Ex

port Method

- **File**: `application/controllers/Inventory_reports.php`
- **Method**: `export_excel()` - Fully implemented comprehensive Excel generation
- **Features Added**:
  - Professional report headers with title, generation date, location, and date filters
  - Dynamic column headers that exclude internal fields (id, product_id, etc.)
  - Row numbering starting from 1
  - Auto-sized columns for better readability
  - Proper data formatting for dates and numeric values
  - Timestamped filename generation
  - Support for all 8 report types:
    - Low Stock Report
    - Stock Valuation Report
    - Expiring Stock Report
    - Expired Stock Report
    - Zero Stock Report
    - Movement Summary Report
    - ABC Analysis Report
    - Turnover Analysis Report

#### 2. ✅ Updated Export Logic

- **Before**: All Excel requests redirected to PDF
- **After**: Proper format detection with dedicated Excel handling
- **PDF Export**: Continues to work via existing redirect mechanism

###

# 3. ✅ Fixed Location Name Retrieval

- **Issue**: Using `search_by_id()` which returns array instead of single object
- **Fix**: Changed to `search_by_row()` which returns single object
- **Impact**: Location names now display correctly in Excel hea
  ders

#### 4. ✅ Validated Implementation

- Excel library (`PHPExcel`) confirmed available and working
- All required models loaded correctly
- No syntax errors in controller
- Frontend properly configured to send Excel export requests
