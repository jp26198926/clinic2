## 🔄 **STOCK MOVEMENTS INTEGRATION**

### ✅ **CRITICAL FEATURE CONFIRMED:**

Every batch transaction **AUTOMATICALLY** creates corresponding stock movements:

1. **RECEIVE Transactions** → `stock_movements_model->receive_stock()`

   - ✅ Increases inventory quantities
   - ✅ Records movement type: `BATCH_RECEIVE`
   - ✅ Links to batch via reference ID

2. **RELEASE Transactions** → `stock_movements_model->release_stock()`

   - ✅ Decreases inventory quantities
   - ✅ Records movement type: `BATCH_RELEASE`
   - ✅ Validates sufficient stock before release

3. **TRANSFER Transactions** → `stock_movements_model->transfer_stock()`
   - ✅ Creates TWO movements (OUT from source, IN to destination)
   - ✅ Updates quantities in both locations
   - ✅ Maintains transfer audit trail

### 🎯 **Movement Tracking Features:**

- ✅ **Batch Reference:** All movements include batch transaction number in notes
- ✅ **User Tracking:** Records who processed the batch
- ✅ **Timestamp Accuracy:** Precise processing timestamps
- ✅ **Error Recovery:** Failed batches are marked as CANCELLED with error details
