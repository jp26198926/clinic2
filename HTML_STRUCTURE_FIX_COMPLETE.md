# INVENTORY BATCH INDEX.PHP - HTML STRUCTURE FIX ✅

## Problem Identified

The `inventory_batch/index.php` file had a **missing `</style>` closing tag** which was causing the HTML structure to be malformed.

## Location of Issue

- **File:** `application/views/inventory_batch/index.php`
- **Line:** After line 208 (where the CSS keyframes ended)
- **Issue:** Missing `</style>` tag before `</head>`

## Fix Applied

**Before:**

```html
        @keyframes fadeHighlight {
            from { background-color: #d4edda; }
            to { background-color: transparent; }
        }

</head>
```

**After:**

```html
        @keyframes fadeHighlight {
            from { background-color: #d4edda; }
            to { background-color: transparent; }
        }
    </style>

</head>
```

## Verification

✅ **PHP Syntax Check:** No syntax errors detected  
✅ **HTML Structure:** All tags properly balanced  
✅ **Style Tags:** Opening `<style>` (line 19) and closing `</style>` (line 209) now match

## Impact of Fix

This missing closing tag was likely causing:

- **Browser rendering issues** - Malformed HTML structure
- **CSS not applying correctly** - Unclosed style block
- **Template loading problems** - Invalid HTML preventing proper page display
- **JavaScript errors** - DOM structure issues

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Login to clinic system** at `http://localhost/clinic2`
3. **Navigate to:** Inventory → Batch Transactions
4. **Expected result:** Page should now display properly with:
   - Complete header and navigation
   - Properly styled interface
   - Working search and filter functionality
   - Responsive mobile layout

## Files Modified

- ✅ `application/views/inventory_batch/index.php` - Added missing `</style>` tag

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The HTML structure issue has been completely resolved. The inventory batch module should now display correctly in all browsers.

**Note:** This was a simple but critical fix. Missing HTML closing tags can cause unexpected rendering behavior and prevent pages from displaying properly, especially in strict HTML parsers.
